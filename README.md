# [Manifest for a positive internet](https://www.for-a-positive-internet.com/)

1. Internet must connect people, not isolate them

2. Internet is a tool, not a world to live within

3. Internet belongs to everybody, accessibility and inclusivity are not optional

4. Internet applications must be designed for common good, not for self-profit

5. Cognitive sciences must be used to prevent addictions and bad behaviours, not to enforce them

6. Money is an energy that must be used to build things, itâ€™s not an end in itself
